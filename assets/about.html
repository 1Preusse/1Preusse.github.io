            <h1>Hi, I'm Konstantin</h1>
            I'm 25 years old and recently completed my master's degree in Biomedical Engineering at the Technical University of Darmstadt. 
            As part of my studies, I spent a semester abroad at the Universitat Politècnica de València (UPV) with an ERASMUS scholarship. A time that strengthened both my technical and intercultural skills.
            <br><br>
            For my master's thesis, titled <em>What Can EEG Really Tell Us About Language? A Deep Learning Study</em>, 
            I worked on decoding language-related brain activity using deep neural networks and electroencephalography data. A field at the intersection of neuroscience, signal processing, 
            and machine learning that I found deeply fascinating.
            <br><br>
            I enjoy exploring diverse fields across engineering and computer science. 
            My interests include medical data science, robotics, machine learning, energy systems, and software development in general. 
            I like building things. From early Arduino projects in school to modern web apps, desktop tools, and data-driven systems.
            <br><br>
            During my studies in Darmstadt, I worked as a teaching assistant for several programming courses, helping students with lecture content and coding assignments. 
            <br><br>
            Additionally, I held two research assistant positions. 
            <br><br>
            In the first one, I developed a desktop application using ElectronJS, ReactJS, and a MATLAB/Python backend that supports grid planning for 
            low-voltage distribution networks. Through this, I gained valuable experience in Git workflows, mathematical optimization, 
            MATLAB, Python, JavaScript, energy science, and technical communication.
            <br><br>
            After completing that project, I joined another research project to develop a toolbox for modeling electrical grids as graphs using real-world data from ENEDIS, 
            France’s largest electricity network operator. This involved extensive data cleaning and analysis, strengthening my skills in SQL (MySQL and PostgreSQL) 
            and Python libraries like Pandas and NetworkX. It also allowed me to work independently and apply many theoretical concepts from my computer science courses. 
            <br><br>
            In my free time, I enjoy swimming and playing Ultimate Frisbee. I also play the piano and guitar, and I’ve been improving my Spanish steadily. 
            I like reading research-based books. My recent favorites include <em>Breathe</em> by James Nestor and <em>Scary Smart</em> by Mo Gawdat (the list keeps changing).
            <br><br>
            I’m always working on side projects, both technical and non-technical. 
            Currently, I’m collaborating with a friend on a website, compete in some medical image kaggle competitions, but I’m always open to new, meaningful projects. 
            Time on this planet is limited, so I aim to make the most of it.
            <br><br>
            I am in the process of evaluating my next career step and whether this should be in academia or in industry 
            to find the best place to continue combining my interests in AI, neuroscience, and software development.
            <br><br>
            If I ever end up in a quote book, I’d like to be remembered with this one
            <em>Life begins when you realize that it will end.</em>
