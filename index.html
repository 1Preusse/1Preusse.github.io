            <h1>Hi, I'm Konstantin</h1>
            I'm 24 years old and currently studying abroad with an ERASMUS Scholarship at the Universitat Politècnica de València (UPV).
            This exchange semester is part of my master studies in biomedical engineering at the Technical University of Darmstadt, building on my bachelor's in
            biomedical engineering and computer engineering. 
            <br><br>
            As my studies suggest, I enjoy exploring different fields of engineering and computer science.
            I'm particularly interested in robotics, machine learning, energy science, and software development of all kinds.
            I like building things, whether it's small Arduino projects from my school days or websites, desktop apps, and useful toolkits today. 
            <br><br>
            During my studies in Darmstadt, I worked as a teaching assistant for various programming courses, helping students with lecture content and their assignments. 
            <br><br>
            Additionally, I worked as a research assistant on two different projects. 
            <br><br>
            In the first position, I developed a desktop app using ElectronJS, ReactJS, and a MATLAB and Python backend that allows for grid planning for
            low-voltage distribution grids. During this time, I learned a lot about Git workflow, mathematical optimization, MATLAB, Python, JavaScript, energy science,
            and presenting my work to experts in the field. 
            <br><br>
             After completing the app, I was offered a research assistant position developing a toolbox for building
            electric grids as graphs, based on real-world data provided by ENEDIS, the largest electricity network operator in France. During this project, I spent a significant
            amount of time obtaining good data and fixing bad data, which allowed me to dive deeper into SQL (MySQL and PostgreSQL), as well as Python libraries such as Pandas
            and NetworkX, which I had previously used for my bachelor thesis. Moreover, this project gave me the freedom to explore various options independently and apply
            many of the theoretical concepts taught in my computer science classes. 
            <br><br>
             In my free time, I swim regularly and enjoy playing Ultimate Frisbee. I also play 
            the piano and guitar, and I'm improving my Spanish on a weekly basis. In addition, I enjoy reading research-based books. My current favorites are *Breathe* by 
            James Nestor, *Thinking, Fast and Slow* by Daniel Kahneman, and *Scary Smart* by Mo Gawdat (the list is always changing and may be outdated). 
            <br> <br>
            I am always working on some side project, tech-related or not. Currently, I am working on two websites with a friend of mine.
            If any interesting projects come up, I'm always eager to help. Time on this planet is limited, so I'm always looking for ways to make the most of it.
            <br><br> 
            If I ever end up in a quote book, I'd like to be quoted with the following: “Life begins when you realize that it will end.”
