            <h1>Hi I'm Konstantin</h1>
            I'm 24 years old and currently on studies abroad with ERASMUS-Scholarship at Universitat Politècnica de València (UPV). The exchange semester is part of my master studies in biomedical engineering  at the Technical University Darmstadt building on my bachelors in biomedical engineering and computer engineer.<br>
            <br>
            As my studies suggest I like to explore different fields of engineering and computer science. I'm especially interested in robotics, machine learning, energy science and in general software development of all kinds. I like to build stuff whether it is small Arduino projects back in School or Websites, Desktop Apps and usefull Toolkits today.<br>
            <br>
            During my studies in Darmstadt I workekd as a teaching assistant for different programming courses, helping students with the lecture contents and their assignments.
            <br>
            Furthermore, I worked as a research assistant for two different projects.<br>
            <br>
            At the first position I developed a desktop app with ElectronJS, ReactJS and a Matlab and Python backend that allows grid planning for low voltage distribution grids. During this time I learned a lot about git workflow, mathematical optimization, MatLab, Python, JavaScript, Energy Science and presenting my work to experts in a field.<br>
            <br>
            After completing the app I was offered a research assistant position developing a tool box for building electric grids as graphs based on real world data provided by ENEDIS, the largest electricity network operator of France.<br>
            During this project I spend a fair amount of time trying to get good data and fixing bad data which allowed me to dive  deeper into the fields of SQL (MySQL and postgresQL), aswell as python libraries such as pandas and networkx which I had previously used for my bachelorthesis. Furthermore, in this project I was allowed to explore many different options independantly and could use many of the theoretical concepts taught in CS classes.       
            <br>
            <br>

            In my free time I go swimming regularly and like to play Ultimate Frisbee. I also play the piano and the guitar and improve my Spanish on a weekly basis.<br>
            In addition I like reading research based books. My favourites at the moment are Breathe by James Nestor, Thinking fast and slow by Daniel Kahneman and Scary Smart by Mo Gawdat. (The list always changes and is probably outdated)<br>
            <br>
            I am always working on some side project tech related or not. Currently I am working on two websites with a friend of mine. But if any interesting projects are offered I am always willing to help.
            The time on this planet is limited so I am always looking for ways to make the most out of it. 
            <br><br>
            If I ever end up in a quote book I would like to be quoted by the following: "Life begins when you realize that it will end."
